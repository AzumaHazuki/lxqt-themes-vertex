# lxqt-themes-vertex

This repository houses ports of the <a href=https://github.com/horst3180/Vertex-theme>Vertex theme</a> by Horst3160 to LXQt. As of the initial upload (24 March 2023), only Vertex-Dark has been ported; the -Light version will likely be forthcoming soon, and possibly variants of both which can pick up on the user's selection highlight color from their assigned palette.
